<b> 🔹 Project Workflow </b>
 
1. Cluster Setup – Created a Kubernetes cluster on Civo Cloud.

2. Application – Wrote a basic Python app that pulls data from the Enviroment where we have a fixed value of my name.

3. Containerization – Built a Docker image and pushed it to Docker Hub.

4. Dependencies – Managed packages with a requirements.txt.

5. Kubernetes Deployment –  

  • Defined a Deployment for the app

  • Exposed it via a Service

  • Configured Ingress for external access <br>

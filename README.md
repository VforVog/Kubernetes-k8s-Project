From Docker to Kubernetes 🚀

This project demonstrates how to containerize a simple Python Hello World app, push it to Docker Hub, and deploy it on a managed Kubernetes cluster using Civo Cloud.

🔹 Project Workflow

Cluster Setup – Created a Kubernetes cluster on Civo Cloud.

Application – Wrote a basic Python Hello World app.

Containerization – Built a Docker image and pushed it to Docker Hub.

Dependencies – Managed packages with a requirements.txt.

Kubernetes Deployment –

Defined a Deployment for the app

Exposed it via a Service

Configured Ingress for external access
